## Data Over Time Visualization
Overview
"Data Over Time" is a visualization project that dynamically represents various datasets as a function of time. The project showcases the integration of geographic and statistical data, rendering changes over a time continuum. It utilizes interactive maps and charts to display the progression of predefined metrics.

Features
Time-Responsive Map Visualization
Dynamic Map Markers: Displays the top 10 cities in the Netherlands with growing circles representing a specific metric that increases over time.
Responsive Design: Each circle appears and grows as the 'time' variable progresses, starting from 0% up to 100%.
Geographical Accuracy: Utilizes precise geographic locations for each city.
Time-Series Data Chart
Interactive Line Chart: Represents a fictional metric for the top 10 cities in the Netherlands.
Progressive Data Reveal: The chart unveils more data points as the 'time' variable increases, showing the metric for each city sequentially.
Technology Stack
React.js: Utilized for building the user interface.
Mapbox GL JS: For rendering interactive maps.
Chart.js and React-Chartjs-2: Used for creating responsive and animated charts.
Styled-Components: For styling the components.
Custom Hooks: For managing global state and time progression.
